# basic-python-on-linux
Demonstrate how some of basic python is handled on Linux

For most of this, there are better ways you can implement some of your goals like logging packages.  The aim of this is just to introduce you to how python can interact with Linux. 

You can use this to demonstrate:
* Test how output is being written to the STDOUT and STDERR buffers
* How you can recieve input from STDIN
* How arguments are different than STDIN

Requirements:
* Python 3.6 or newer
